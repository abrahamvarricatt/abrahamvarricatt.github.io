    <section><p>For a year, I subscribed to IRCCloud. It&#8217;s a good service that let&#8217;s me stay
connected to different chatrooms. In the year that I&#8217;ve been a customer, it has
served me well. So, why change? It costs <span class="caps">USD</span> $50/year. Recently, it has come to
my attention that you can rent servers on vultr for just <span class="caps">USD</span>&nbsp;$2.5/month.</p>
<p>Granted, it&#8217;s a really low-end server, but for the needs of a single user it
might just fit my needs. To my pleasant surprise, it&nbsp;works!</p>

<p>The basic idea works like this - rent a server, install thelounge on it, setup
credentials, activate it as a service and connect via a web&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Renting a server was easy - just pay vultr, tell them I need the cheapest
ubuntu server they could offer and save the root credentails - <span class="caps">SSH</span> to verify
that the system was provisioned and I was in&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>Installing thelounge was a bit tricky - I didn&#8217;t know where to start! But that
was solved by looking up the dependency tree. The Lounge was built on the
nodejs interpretor. Which meant that I needed to get that installed. There were
a few versions available, and I decided on the v6.x <span class="caps">LTS</span> series. Steps went like,
install <span class="caps">GPG</span> key from nodesource, add the repository to apt-get and install&nbsp;nodejs.</p>
<p>Installing louge was straight-forward after that. I wasn&#8217;t interested in running
anything else on the server, so I just installed it globally via the npm install
command. Not really sure what that means from a system hardening perspective,
but for a single user system, should be fine. I think. Worst case, just throw
out the server, get a new one and&nbsp;repeat.</p>
<p>Next step was to ensure that thelounge would be running as a service. Time to
configure systemd. I made a configuration file and copied that over to my
vultr&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Additionally, I also created a user.json file, self-signed <span class="caps">SSL</span> credentials and
restarted the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Last step was to connect to it over a web browser via <span class="caps">IP</span>. (Didn&#8217;t want to setup
<span class="caps">DNS</span> for&nbsp;this)</p>
<p>And it&nbsp;worked!</p>
<p>For my next step, I&#8217;m thinking of automating the process. Perhaps I&#8217;ll make a
dedicated project on how to deploy the server and share it on github. I have
an ansible script that I built, but that&#8217;s for another&nbsp;time.</p>
