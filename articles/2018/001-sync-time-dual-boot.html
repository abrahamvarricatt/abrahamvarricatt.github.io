    <section><p>The time displayed by my <span class="caps">OS</span> is different between Ubuntu and Windows 10. Opening
the settings screen on Windows on each bootup, turning the time sync off/on was
getting tiring. Here is how I solved the problem in a more permanent&nbsp;manner.</p>

<p>The root cause of the issue is due to difference in behaviour with how each <span class="caps">OS</span>
was treating the time reported by <span class="caps">BIOS</span>. Ubuntu treated it as <span class="caps">UTC</span> time, but
Windows treated it as localtime. This meant that when either of the operating
systems would sync time against an online time server, it would set the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>
clock in a manner different than the other&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>Between the two approaches - use <span class="caps">BIOS</span> time as either <span class="caps">UTC</span> or local, I would
personally prefer <span class="caps">UTC</span>. This would mean that <span class="caps">BIOS</span> would not need to be updated
each time daylight savings came round every year, or if I was travelling and
switched&nbsp;time-zones.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Windows does not make it easy to use the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> clock as <span class="caps">UTC</span> time.
Technically it&#8217;s possible, but it involves messing around with the Registry
Editor and I&#8217;m worried that other applications wouldn&#8217;t play well with the&nbsp;changes.</p>
<p>Which leaves modifying Ubuntu as the other option. Fortunately, this isn&#8217;t too
difficult. Just run the following&nbsp;command,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ timedatectl set-local-rtc <span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What the above does, is tell Ubuntu to treat the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> clock as localtime.
Restarting my system a few times and switching between the <span class="caps">OS</span>&#8217;s confirms that
it&nbsp;works.</p>
