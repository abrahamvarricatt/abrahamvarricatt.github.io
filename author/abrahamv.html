    <section><p>The Python language has a feature called <cite>Generator Expressions</cite> which were
introduced with <span class="caps">PEP</span> 289. You can think of them as a better way of doing certain
operations involving lists. This post is more interested in the memory benefits
the feature provides. We will first introduce the <cite>memory_profiler</cite> tool which
can be used to measure the memory usage of a python program. We will then
compare two different pieces of code (one with and the other without generator
expressions) which perform the same operation, explaining why one is more
superior than the other. Finally, we will run a few experiments to demonstrate
and prove our assertion.</p>

    <section><p>When designing websites using Bootstrap 4, I found it challenging to figure out
which widths corresponded to which breakpoint. This post describes the <span class="caps">HTML</span>
layout I came up with to display a small banner (during development) to help me
visualize the different breakpoints.</p>

the settings screen on Windows on each bootup, turning the time sync off/on was
getting tiring. Here is how I solved the problem in a more permanent manner.</p>

    <section><p>For a year, I subscribed to IRCCloud. It’s a good service that let’s me stay
connected to different chatrooms. In the year that I’ve been a customer, it has
served me well. So, why change? It costs <span class="caps">USD</span> $50/year. Recently, it has come to
my attention that you can rent servers on vultr for just <span class="caps">USD</span> $2.5/month.</p>
<p>Granted, it’s a really low-end server, but for the needs of a single user it
might just fit my needs. To my pleasant surprise, it works!</p>
