I've decided to start writing publicly again. But this time, instead of writing to some audience, I'm going to write to myself. You know, it's kind-of lame to write the first post as some kind of explanation on WHY I'm writing instead of just
getting into the heart of the issue. Thing is - I don't have anything compelleing to write right now. 

So, in that sense, this post is going to be a test. A test to see if I can just type in github's interface to add a new
post (text-only) and well, I'm curious to see how this looks like if there is no heading at the top of the words - like
does the post title count, or will I need to make something else?

I think to myself that I should have used Markdown, but it's seems difficult to get into. i.e. to get my current tooling to
work with it. On a different note, the Nikola project seems active and I might actually contribute to it .. if I can understand it. The impression I get from the documentation, is that this is a tool that tries to be something for everyone. The frightening thing is - they've kind of succeeded. To the point that no-one can easily jump in to work with it. 

Perhaps I can make an Edison site? To market the tool? Would be an amusing concept. :)
